The same applies to LoggingViewerLevelsComponent\nand LoggingViewerSearchComponent.\nBut for the LoggingViewerModalComponent, multi language support is needed,\nsince the modal contains some translatable texts. Therefore,\nloggingViewerModalManager.openModal() has a language parameter, which you can\nuse to select the language. Currently en and de are supported.\nIf you need another language, either open an issue, or just use the translation parameter.\nThis parameter you can use to pass your completely own texts.\nJust fill the LoggingViewerTranslation object.\nAPI\nsee API documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        LoggingViewerModule\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    4 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Injectable\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 17.0.0\n        \n            Description : Viewer component for logs written by ionic-logging-service\n        \n            Keywords : ionic, mobile, logging, log4javascript\n        \n            License : MIT\n        \n            Repository : https://github.com/Ritzlgrmft/ionic-logging-service.git\n        \n            Author : Markus Wagner\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
