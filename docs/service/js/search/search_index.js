The next step is typically the configuration (see below). And then, finally, you can use the LoggingService in your code, e.g.:\nExample :import { Logger, LoggingService } from \"ionic-logging-service\";\n\nexport class MyComponent {\n\n  private logger: Logger;\n\n  constructor(\n    loggingService: LoggingService) {\n\n    this.logger = loggingService.getLogger(\"MyApp.MyComponent\");\n    const methodName = \"ctor\";\n    this.logger.entry(methodName);\n\n    ...\n\n    this.logger.exit(methodName);\n  }\n\n  public myMethod(index: number, message: string): number[] {\n    const methodName = \"myMethod\";\n    this.logger.entry(methodName, index, number);\n\n    try {\n      ...\n    } catch (e) {\n      this.logger.error(methodName, \"some error\", e);\n    }\n\n    this.logger.exit(methodName);\n    return result;\n  }\n}Depending how the code is called, this could produce the following output in the browser's console:\nExample :I  18:49:43.794  MyApp.MyComponent  ctor  entry\nI  18:49:43.797  MyApp.MyComponent  ctor  exit\nI  18:49:43.801  MyApp.MyComponent  myMethod  entry  42  Hello\nE  18:49:43.814  MyApp.MyComponent  myMethod  some error\nI  18:49:43.801  MyApp.MyComponent  myMethod  exit  [2, 5, 99]Logger\nA logger is the component responsible for logging. Typically, you have one logger per every class. The logger name describe the place where in your app the class is placed. The single parts are separated by dots ('.'). This is quite the same as with namespaces in dotnet or packages in Java.\nThis builds some kind of hierarchy. E.g., if you have a logger named A.B.C.D, you get automatically also loggers for A.B.C, A.B and A. Additionally, there is the so-called root logger, which is the parent of all other loggers.\nThe hierarchy is important, since the loggers inherit the log level from there parent - if there is no other level defined. That means, you can define just one log level for the complete app (by setting the root logger's level), and you can par example define, you do not want to see logs written for logger A.B.C (this includes also A.B.C.D).\nLevel\nEvery log message has a level. This is the severity of the message. Available levels are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL - these correspond to the logging methods trace, debug, info, warn, error and fatal of Logger. Levels are ordered as follows: TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR FATAL. This means the FATAL is the most severe and TRACE the least. Also included are levels called ALL and OFF intended to enable or disable all logging respectively.\nSetting a level to a logger disables log messages of severity lower than that level. For instance, if a level of INFO is set on a logger then only log messages of severity INFO or greater will be logged, meaning DEBUG and TRACE messages will not be logged.\nAppender\nAppenders make the logs visible, e.g. by writing them to the browser's console. This is quite useful during development, either in console or using ionic serve --consolelogs. But later, you will need other logs:\n\nAjaxAppender: sends the log messages to a backend server\nMemoryAppender: keeps the log messages in memory\nLocalStorageAppender: stores the log messages in local storage\n\nIf you want to see a complete example, have a look at ionic-feedback-sample.\nConfiguration\nBy default, the following configuration is used:\n\nLogger:\n\nroot: Level.WARN\n\n\nAppender:\n\nBrowserConsoleAppender\nMemoryAppender\n\n\n\nTo change it, just call configure(). This method takes an object of type LoggingServiceConfiguration.\nThe recommended way is to place the configuration in environment.ts:\nExample :export const environment = {\n  logging: {\n    ...\n  }\n};Call configure() in your app.config.ts:\nExample :export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    provideAppInitializer(() => {\n      const loggingService = inject(LoggingService);\n      loggingService.configure(environment.logging);\n    }),\n  ]\n};logLevels\nlogLevels gets an array of log level definitions for different loggers, e.g.\nExample :{\n  \"logLevels\": [\n    {\n      \"loggerName\": \"root\",\n      \"logLevel\": \"DEBUG\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"loggerName\": \"MyApp.MyNamespace.MyLogger\",\n      \"logLevel\": \"INFO\"\n    }\n  ]\n};That means, instead of the default log level WARN, you want to log all messages with level DEBUG and higher. Only for MyApp.MyNamespace.MyLogger, you want to restrict the level to INFO.\najaxAppender\nWith ajaxAppender, you add an additional appender of type AjaxAppender, which sends the log messages to a backend server.\nbrowserConsoleAppender\nWith browserConsoleAppender, it is possible to configure the BrowserConsoleAppender, which writes the log to the browser's console.\nlocalStorageAppender\nWith localStorageAppender, you add an additional appender of type LocalStorageAppender, which stores log messages in the local storage.\nmemoryAppender\nWith memoryAppender, it is possible to configure the MemoryAppender, which keeps log messages in the memory.\nAPI\nsee API documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Injectable\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    6 Classes\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    6 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        0 \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 21.0.0\n        \n            Description : Logging functionalities for apps built with Ionic framework\n        \n            Keywords : ionic, mobile, logging, log4javascript\n        \n            License : MIT\n        \n            Repository : https://github.com/Ritzlgrmft/ionic-logging-service.git\n        \n            Author : Markus Wagner\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"routes.html":{"url":"routes.html","title":"routes - routes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Routes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
